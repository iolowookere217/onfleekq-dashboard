# React + Vite + Tailwind

# Project Name: onfleekq-dashboard

# React + Vite

This is a react vite project with tailwind styling.

To view this project in your localhost:

- clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/iolowookere217/onfleekq-dashboard.git
- cd into the onfleekq directory
- run npm i to install the dependencies
- run npm run dev to open the web app in your localhost

STEPS TAKEN:

- In the src folder, you will find 4 folders namely components, pages, routes and utils
- I created some helpful re-useable components like buttons, inputs, protected layout, sidebar, navlinks, header, loading, progress, and spending progress.
- Images and logo are stored in the public folder
- I created the landing page and the dashboard page
- The landing page has 4 files namely home, head, banner and the index(route)
- The dashboard has four files which are chart, chart2, finance-dashboard and the index(route)

CHALLENGES FACED:

- I could not work with the figma file hence it took me longer time to finish the dashboard
- I had issues with the protected layout when I was trying to make the page responsive for other screens
- I will need a little more time to work on the responsiveness of the dashboard.
